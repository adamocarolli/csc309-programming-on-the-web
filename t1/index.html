		<!-- Fun TidBit on Character Encoding:  
		     	Necessary Definitions: 
		     	`glyph`: a graphical symbol like A, B, H, ~
			`grapheme`: a glyph associated with a particular sound
			`codepoint`: a # corresponding to a specific grapheme
			
			Explanation:
			An `encoding` is an assignment of codepoints to sequence of bytes. In
	       		practice we have some standard encodings, a simple one is ASCII. However,
			we need a larger encoding to encompass all the worlds graphemes, not just 
			European ones, Unicode refers to one such `abstract character set`, `utf-8`
			is one such encoding of that abstract character set.
